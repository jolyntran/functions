This is my fifth project in Typography and Interaction 2 (Spring 2025). Ctrl Z is a web-based ambient noise player that allows users to mix and control various types of noise (e.g., white noise, pink noise, brown noise, etc.) to create the perfect sound environment for relaxation, study, or sleep. The app offers sliders for each noise type, a master volume control, and interactive pulsing menu dots that provide a visual cue when a noise track is playing.
